# Quizlet Clone - Vibe Coding Project

This project is a Quizlet clone built as part of the Vibe Coding series, created using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model in a one-shot development approach.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to create, study, and share flashcards for educational purposes. It mimics the core functionality of Quizlet while demonstrating the capabilities of AI-assisted development.

## Features Implemented

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and user profile management
- **Flashcard Creation**: Create, edit, and delete flashcard sets
- **Study Modes**: Multiple study modes including:
  - Flashcard review
  - Multiple choice quizzes
  - Written response tests

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works across devices
- **User Dashboard**: Personalized dashboard showing user's sets and study progress

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with styled-components for UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure user authentication
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker for easy deployment

## Development Process

This project was developed using Gemini 2.5 Pro in a one-shot approach, demonstrating how AI can assist in rapidly prototyping and developing full-stack applications. The development process included:

1. Initial requirements gathering and system design
2. Frontend and backend implementation
3. Database schema design and integration
4. Testing and refinement
5. Documentation

## Future Enhancements
